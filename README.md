# Credit Approval AI

**Credit Approval AI** is a machine learning application designed to predict loan approval eligibility based on user-provided financial information. The application is built using **Flask** for the backend API and **Streamlit** for the frontend web interface. It uses a pre-trained **LightGBM** model to make predictions and stores the user's input data in an SQLite database.

## Features

- **Loan Prediction**: Predict loan approval based on a variety of features such as age, income, credit history, etc.
- **User Input Form**: A simple, intuitive form for users to input their financial details and check their eligibility for a loan.
- **Database**: Stores the user input along with the prediction result in an SQLite database.
- **Model**: Uses a pre-trained **LightGBM** model to generate predictions based on the user's inputs.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Flask 2.1.0
- Flask-Cors 3.1.1
- Streamlit 1.18.0
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib
- sqlite3 (comes with Python)
- requests

Install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/creditapprovalai.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd creditapprovalai
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
1. Running the Flask API
The backend API is built using Flask. To start the API server:

bash
Copy code
python api.py
By default, the Flask app will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000. This will expose an endpoint /predict where users can send a POST request to get loan eligibility predictions.

2. Running the Streamlit Web Application
The frontend of the application is built using Streamlit. To launch the web interface:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run loan_app.py
This will start a local Streamlit server and open the app in your browser, where users can input their financial information and check their loan eligibility.

3. Interacting with the API
To interact with the API programmatically (outside of the Streamlit interface), you can send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with the required user data:

Example of JSON input:

json
Copy code
{
    "person_age": 30,
    "person_income": 50000,
    "person_home_ownership": "OWN",
    "person_emp_length": 5,
    "loan_intent": "PERSONAL",
    "loan_amnt": 10000,
    "loan_int_rate": 15.0,
    "loan_percent_income": 0.2,
    "cb_person_default_on_file": "N",
    "cb_person_cred_length": 5
}
Note: You can use the requests library in Python to send the data, as done in the Streamlit app.

4. Checking Database Records
This application stores the user inputs and predictions in an SQLite database (user_data.db). You can inspect the stored records by running the following code:

python
Copy code
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('user_data.db') 
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM user_input")
rows = cursor.fetchall()

for row in rows:
    print(row)

conn.close()
This will fetch all records stored in the user_input table and print them to the console.

Data
The model was trained on a historical dataset of loan approval decisions. The application uses this model to predict eligibility for new loan applications based on user input.

user_data.db: SQLite database that stores the user inputs along with the eligibility result.
updated_lgbm_model.joblib: The pre-trained LightGBM model used for predicting loan eligibility.
credit_risk_dataset.csv: Sample dataset used to train the model (can be used for training or testing).
Database Schema
The SQLite database (user_data.db) contains a table called user_input with the following columns:

id: Primary key (autoincrement).
person_age: Age of the user.
person_income: Income of the user.
person_home_ownership: Home ownership status (RENT, OWN, MORTGAGE).
person_emp_length: Years of employment.
loan_intent: Intent for the loan (e.g., PERSONAL, EDUCATION, etc.).
loan_amnt: Loan amount requested.
loan_int_rate: Interest rate for the loan.
loan_percent_income: Percentage of income being requested as a loan.
cb_person_default_on_file: Whether there is a default on file (Y or N).
cb_person_cred_length: Length of the credit history in years.
eligibility: The loan approval status ("1" for eligible, "0" for not eligible).
Example Usage
Streamlit Interface:
Go to the home page and click "Get Started Now" to begin the loan eligibility check process.
Fill out the form with your personal and financial information.
Click "Check Eligibility" to get the prediction.
The eligibility result will be displayed, along with the details of the form you filled out.
API Usage:
To use the API, you can send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with the required data in JSON format. The API will respond with a success message and loan eligibility status (1 for eligible, 0 for not eligible).

Example POST request:

bash
Copy code
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "person_age": 30,
    "person_income": 50000,
    "person_home_ownership": "OWN",
    "person_emp_length": 5,
    "loan_intent": "PERSONAL",
    "loan_amnt": 10000,
    "loan_int_rate": 15.0,
    "loan_percent_income": 0.2,
    "cb_person_default_on_file": "N",
    "cb_person_cred_length": 5
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
    "message": "Prediction successful",
    "eligibility": "1"
}
